Hi, I’m @GQuinteroP. I'm Electronics and Communications Engineer, Master in Science in Computer Engineering and PhD in Environmental Engineering (Environmental Acoustics).
My research interest is mainly in electronics and computing focused on acoustics, wether it is underwater or environmental acoustics.

Here I will be posting my current and probably past projects. I’m looking to collaborate on acoustics in general, noise pollution, underwater noise mapping, among many others.

Please, feel free to contact me directly to my personal e-mail: guillermo.quintero.p@gmail.com
